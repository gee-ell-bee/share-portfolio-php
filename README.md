# prof. Bennett:

i added every file that's related to the home page so it functions well enough & limits visual distractions.

i also tried to preserve the file organization structure to minimize broken links.

start with site > snippets > home-boxes.php, since that's where i list in detail all the tasks i'm trying to accomplish. i tried to explain what i wanted to do in terms of how i think one would code it in php, which hopefully saves you time translating what i want to do into code and (maybe?) made my explanation clearer.

i can also come to office hours if you need me to help walk you through it, i know this is complicated.

thank you in advance for your help!
let me know if there's anything else you need from me!

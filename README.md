# prof. Bennett:

i added every file that's relevant to my goals, all the css + js files related to that page, plus the "top" and "nav" snippets to make sure the page functions well enough & limits visual distractions.

i also tried to preserve the file organization structure to minimize broken links.

let me know if there's anything else you need from me!!
